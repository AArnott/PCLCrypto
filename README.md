PCLCrypto
=========

Cryptography for portable class libraries.


### FAQ

#### How does this differ from the cryptography offered to PCLs in the [PCLContrib][1] project?

 * PCLCrypto is focused on just delivering cryptography, with a good level of unit testing that runs on all supported platforms.
 * PCLCrypto follows the NuGet consumption patterns of [PCLStorage][3], which makes it very easy to consume from both PCLs and your platform-specific apps.
 * PCLCrypto is under active development. PCLContrib [hasn't been updated in a while][2].
